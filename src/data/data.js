    intro: `Welcome ! My name is Alexandre. I am former marketer and I started coding back in the beginning of 2018 when I joined a 5-month coding bootcamp.
    I then joined fintech and edtech companies as a junior full-stack developer and I am now looking for my next role.

    I love learning new things constantly and trying to improve my skills, you can be assured that I will do whatever I can to make the product or website you're dreaming of. `,
