    intro:
      `Welcome ! My name is Alexandre, I am a French JavaScript full-stack developer. Previously working as a project manager, I turned my life around and started coding back in 2018, when I joined a 5 month coding bootcamp. 
      This got me into working for finance and education companies as a junior developer. I love learning new things constantly, and you can rest assured that despite being a junior, I will do whatever it takes to deliver the product or website you wish for.`,
